## Summary

This is a test for one portion of the [Tasseography](https://apoorvaraob.github.io/tea-reading/) project, which was developed as part of the P5.js week of the 2020 Gray Area Intensive course. I used examples from the [Generative Design](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/)website, specifically this ['font generator with static elements'](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_3_2_1_02) and this ['interpolation of random to order sketch'](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?02_M/M_1_2_01), to create the effect of a secret message in the tea leaves. The teacup is a .png file inserted as a background image.
