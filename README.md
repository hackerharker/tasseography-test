## Summary

This project allows users to generate a visualization based on data from a list of plants they select. This project focuses on plants that are tolerant of or adapted to serpentine soils and that are native to the Potrero Hill Neighborhood in San Francisco. This tool will be used to deveop the planting plan for the [Eco-Patch](https://www.greenbenefit.org/project-blog/2020/7/10/7h2nn73s0ae13hhxm61nwnjdnvkkls) project, which seeks to encourage people to use native plants with high habitat and biodiversity value. After using it to develop the Eco-Patch planting plan, this tool will be provided as part of an outreach effort as a way to further engage people with the Eco-Patch plants. The intention is that this tool, in coordination with physical Eco-Patch garden, will help people figure out which combinations of plants provide year-round interest in the form of flowers or green foliage. The beta version of this application can be found [here](https://github.com/hackerharker/Plant-Visually_Beta-Version).
